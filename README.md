# Calculator-lite
Welcome to the Calculator Lite! This calculator provides a range of functions for basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, you can perform square, square root, and change sign operations. This calculator showcases front-end development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project adheres to MVC (Model-View-Controller) principles, demonstrating a structured architecture without relying on additional modules.

## Motivation
The primary goal of this project is to highlight proficiency in front-end technologies, emphasizing:

**HTML**: Used to structure the content and layout of the calculator.

**CSS**: Handles styling and design elements, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

**JavaScript**: Powers the interactivity and functionality of the calculator, incorporating **MVC** principles for a clean and organized codebase.

## Features
**Addition (+)**: Add numbers together for simple arithmetic.

**Subtraction (-)**: Subtract one number from another.

**Multiplication (x)**: Multiply two numbers to get the result.

**Division (/)**: Divide one number by another.

**Square (x²)**: Square a number, multiplying it by itself.

**Square Root (√)**: Find the square root of a number.

**Change Sign (+/-)**: Switch between positive and negative values.

**History Tracking**: View a record of your calculation.

**Clear Last (C)**: Delete the last entered symbol or operation. If the last operation was '=', it removes the history.

**Clear All (CA)**: Delete everything, including the current number.

**Repeated Equals (=)**: Pressing '=' multiple times consecutively will repeat the last operation.

### Repeated Equals and Other Operations
If you press the '=' button multiple times consecutively, the calculator will repeat the last operation. This feature allows for quick calculations without re-entering the entire expression.

#### Examples
* To calculate 10 + 5, press '10', '+', '5', and '=', resulting in '15'.
* To perform consecutive calculations like 10 + 5 + 5 + 5, continue pressing '=' two more times, resulting in '25'.
* To find the square root of 25, press '5', and '√', resulting in '5'. Press '√' again to get '2.236067977'.

## How to Use
1. **Numeric Buttons**: Use the numeric buttons to enter numbers.

2. **Operation Buttons**: Select the operation you want to perform (+, -, x, /, x², √, +/-).

3. *(Optional)* Enter second number using buttons.

4. **Clear Last (C) Button**: You can change number or operation by deleting with 'C' button.

5. **Change Sign (+/-) Button**: Switch between positive and negative values.

6. **Equals (=) Button**: Press the '=' button to calculate the result.

7. **Clear All (CA) Button**: Delete everything to beging new chain of calculations.
